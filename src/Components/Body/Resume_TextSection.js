                    Computers and computer science in general have been my hobby since I was eight years old. Last year I decided to follow my dreams and turn this hobby into a new professional career. I left my previous job, shortly after I applied to a JavaScript advanced course. I decided it is а good starting point, because of the possibility to work at frontend and backend in a single language, and because of my previous experience.

                    I’m having interest in DevOps and ethical hacking too. In my free time I like to read books, hiking, or gym. What I am looking for is the opportunity to learn new things and the challenges to solve tasks that are beyond my current knowledge.
